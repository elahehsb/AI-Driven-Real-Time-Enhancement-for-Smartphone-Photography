# AI-Driven-Real-Time-Enhancement-for-Smartphone-Photography

### Project Overview
Smartphone photography has become an integral part of our daily lives, with millions of photos taken every day. However, despite advancements in camera hardware, challenges such as low-light conditions, motion blur, and noise still affect image quality. This project aims to develop advanced AI-driven real-time enhancement algorithms for smartphone photography, focusing on improving image quality in challenging conditions while maintaining the speed and efficiency required for real-time processing on mobile devices.

The goal is to create a set of algorithms that can be integrated into smartphone camera applications, enhancing images in real-time as they are captured. This will involve developing methods for noise reduction, motion deblurring, and detail enhancement, leveraging deep learning techniques to deliver high-quality images with minimal computational overhead.

### Project Goals
##### 1. Real-Time Noise Reduction: 
Develop efficient noise reduction algorithms that can operate in real-time on smartphone hardware, particularly under low-light conditions.
##### 2. Motion Deblurring: 
Create AI-based methods to reduce motion blur in images taken in dynamic environments or with shaky hands.
##### 3. Detail Enhancement: 
Implement algorithms to enhance the fine details in images, making them appear sharper and more vibrant.
##### 4. Mobile Optimization: 
Ensure the algorithms are optimized for the limited computational resources of smartphones, enabling seamless integration into existing camera apps.
##### 5. User-Centric Design: 
Design the enhancements to be subtle and natural, improving image quality without making the enhancements noticeable or artificial.
